# Screen-Casting-Using-ARQ
This project implements ARQ protocols (Stop-and-Wait, Go-Back-N, and Selective Repeat) to achieve reliable screen casting over unstable networks. It simulates packet loss and delay, analyzing retransmissions, throughput, and latency to ensure smooth and efficient real-time video streaming.
